	abstract={I-Mutant2.0 is a support vector machine (SVM)-based tool for the automatic prediction of protein stability changes upon single point mutations. I-Mutant2.0 predictions are performed starting either from the protein structure or, more importantly, from the protein sequence. This latter task, to the best of our knowledge, is exploited for the first time. The method was trained and tested on a data set derived from ProTherm, which is presently the most comprehensive available database of thermodynamic experimental data of free energy changes of protein stability upon mutation under different conditions. I-Mutant2.0 can be used both as a classifier for predicting the sign of the protein stability change upon mutation and as a regression estimator for predicting the related DeltaDeltaG values. Acting as a classifier, I-Mutant2.0 correctly predicts (with a cross-validation procedure) 80\% or 77\% of the data set, depending on the usage of structural or sequence information, respectively. When predicting DeltaDeltaG values associated with mutations, the correlation of predicted with expected/experimental values is 0.71 (with a standard error of 1.30 kcal/mol) and 0.62 (with a standard error of 1.45 kcal/mol) when structural or sequence information are respectively adopted. Our web interface allows the selection of a predictive mode that depends on the availability of the protein structure and/or sequence. In this latter case, the web server requires only pasting of a protein sequence in a raw format. We therefore introduce I-Mutant2.0 as a unique and valuable helper for protein design, even when the protein structure is not yet known with atomic resolution.

	abstract={MOTIVATION: Mutations in human genome are mainly through single nucleotide polymorphism, some of which can affect stability and function of proteins, causing human diseases. Several methods have been proposed to predict the effect of mutations on protein stability; but most require features from experimental structure. Given the fast progress in protein structure prediction, this work explores the possibility to improve the mutation-induced stability change prediction using low-resolution structure modeling. RESULTS: We developed a new method (STRUM) for predicting stability change caused by single-point mutations. Starting from wild-type sequences, 3D models are constructed by the iterative threading assembly refinement (I-TASSER) simulations, where physics- and knowledge-based energy functions are derived on the I-TASSER models and used to train STRUM models through gradient boosting regression. STRUM was assessed by 5-fold cross validation on 3421 experimentally determined mutations from 150 proteins. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between predicted and measured changes of Gibbs free-energy gap, DDG, upon mutation reaches 0.79 with a root-mean-square error 1.2 kcal/mol in the mutation-based cross-validations. The PCC reduces if separating training and test mutations from non-homologous proteins, which reflects inherent correlations in the current mutation sample. Nevertheless, the results significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods, including those built on experimental protein structures. Detailed analyses show that the most sensitive features in STRUM are the physics-based energy terms on I-TASSER models and the conservation scores from multiple-threading template alignments. However, the DDG prediction accuracy has only a marginal dependence on the accuracy of protein structure models as long as the global fold is correct. These data demonstrate the feasibility to use low-resolution structure modeling for high-accuracy stability change prediction upon point mutations.

	abstract={A basic question of protein structural studies is to which extent mutations affect the stability. This question may be addressed starting from sequence and/or from structure. In proteomics and genomics studies prediction of protein stability free energy change (DDG) upon single point mutation may also help the annotation process. The experimental DDG values are affected by uncertainty as measured by standard deviations. Most of the DDG values are nearly zero (about 32\% of the DDG data set ranges from -0.5 to 0.5 kcal/mole) and both the value and sign of DDG may be either positive or negative for the same mutation blurring the relationship among mutations and expected DDG value. In order to overcome this problem we describe a new predictor that discriminates between 3 mutation classes: destabilizing mutations (DDG<-1.0 kcal/mol), stabilizing mutations (DDG>1.0 kcal/mole) and neutral mutations (-1.0<=DDG<=1.0 kcal/mole).},

	abstract={Accurately predicting changes in protein stability upon amino acid substitution is a much sought after goal. Destabilizing mutations are often implicated in disease, whereas stabilizing mutations are of great value for industrial and therapeutic biotechnology. Increasing protein stability is an especially challenging task, with random substitution yielding stabilizing mutations in only {\textasciitilde}2\% of cases. To overcome this bottleneck, computational tools that aim to predict the effect of mutations have been developed; however, achieving accuracy and consistency remains challenging. Here, we combined 11 freely available tools into a meta-predictor (meieringlab.uwaterloo.ca/stabilitypredict/). Validation against {\textasciitilde}600 experimental mutations indicated that our meta-predictor has improved performance over any of the individual tools. The meta-predictor was then used to recommend 10 mutations in a previously designed protein of moderate thermodynamic stability, ThreeFoil. Experimental characterization showed that four mutations increased protein stability and could be amplified through ThreeFoil's structural symmetry to yield several multiple mutants with >2-kcal/mol stabilization. By avoiding residues within functional ties, we could maintain ThreeFoil's glycan-binding capacity. Despite successfully achieving substantial stabilization, however, almost all mutations decreased protein solubility, the most common cause of protein design failure. Examination of the 600-mutation data set revealed that stabilizing mutations on the protein surface tend to increase hydrophobicity and that the individual tools favor this approach to gain stability. Thus, whereas currently available tools can increase protein stability and combining them into a meta-predictor yields enhanced reliability, improvements to the potentials/force fields underlying these tools are needed to avoid gaining protein stability at the cost of solubility.},

Stability predictors computationally predict protein?stability changes caused by mutations. We performed a systematic analysis of 11 online stability predictors' performances. These predictors are CUPSAT, Dmutant, FoldX, I-Mutant2.0, two versions of I-Mutant3.0 (sequence and structure versions), MultiMutate, MUpro, SCide, Scpred, and SRide. As input, 1,784 single mutations found in 80 proteins were used, and these mutations did not include those used for training. The programs' performances were also assessed according to where the mutations were found in the proteins, that is, in secondary structures and on the surface or in the core of a protein, and according to protein structure type. The extents to which the mutations altered the occupied volumes at the residue sites and the charge interactions were also characterized. The predictions of all programs were in line with the experimental data. I-Mutant3.0 (utilizing structural information), Dmutant, and FoldX were the most reliable predictors. The stability-center predictors performed with similar accuracy. However, at best, the predictions were only moderately accurate (?60\%) and significantly better tools would be needed for routine analysis of mutation effects.

It requires the protein structure in Protein Data Bank format and the location of the residue to be mutated. The output consists information about mutation site, its structural features (solvent accessibility, secondary structure and torsion angles), and comprehensive information about changes in protein stability for 19 possible substitutions of a specific amino acid mutation. Additionally, it also analyses the ability of the mutated amino acids to adapt the observed torsion angles. Results were tested on 1538 mutations from thermal denaturation and 1603 mutations from chemical denaturation experiments. Several validation tests (split-sample, jack-knife and k-fold) were carried out to ensure the reliability, accuracy and transferability of the prediction method that gives >80\% prediction accuracy for most of these validation tests.

Such models are also valuable for the design and engineering of new proteins. Previously described methods have utilized properties of protein sequence or structure to predict the free energy change of mutants due to thermal (ΔΔG) and denaturant (ΔΔGH2O) denaturations, as well as mutant thermal stability (ΔTm), through the application of either computational energy-based approaches or machine learning techniques. However, accuracy associated with applying these methods separately is frequently far from optimal.Results: We detail a computational mutagenesis technique based on a four-body, knowledge-based, statistical contact potential. For any mutation due to a single amino acid replacement in a protein, the method provides an empirical normalized measure of the ensuing environmental perturbation occurring at every residue position. A feature vector is generated for the mutant by considering perturbations at the mutated position and it's ordered six nearest neighbors in the 3-dimensional (3D) protein structure. These predictors of stability change are evaluated by applying machine learning tools to large training sets of mutants derived from diverse proteins that have been experimentally studied and described. Predictive models based on our combined approach are either comparable to, or in many cases significantly outperform, previously published results.Availability: A web server with supporting documentation is available at http://proteins.gmu.edu/automuteContact:ivaisman@gmu.edu}",

	abstract={Folding free energy is an important biophysical characteristic of proteins that reflects the overall stability of the 3D structure of macromolecules. Changes in the amino acid sequence, naturally occurring or made in vitro, may affect the stability of the corresponding protein and thus could be associated with disease. Several approaches that predict the changes of the folding free energy caused by mutations have been proposed, but there is no method that is clearly superior to the others. The optimal goal is not only to accurately predict the folding free energy changes, but also to characterize the structural changes induced by mutations and the physical nature of the predicted folding free energy changes. Here we report a new method to predict the Single Amino Acid Folding free Energy Changes (SAAFEC) based on a knowledge-modified Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) approach. The method is comprised of two main components: a MM/PBSA component and a set of knowledge based terms delivered from a statistical study of the biophysical characteristics of proteins. The predictor utilizes a multiple linear regression model with weighted coefficients of various terms optimized against a set of experimental data. The aforementioned approach yields a correlation coefficient of 0.65 when benchmarked against 983 cases from 42 proteins in the ProTherm database.

	abstract = "Recently, cloud computing gained an important role in healthcare services (HCS) due to its ability to improve the HCS performance. However, the optimal selection of virtual machines (VMs) to process a medical request represents a big challenge. Optimal selection of VMs performs a significant enhancement of the performance through reducing the execution time of medical requests (tasks) coming from stakeholders (patients, doctors, etc.) and maximizing utilization of cloud resources. For that, this paper proposes a new model for HCS based on cloud environment using Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO) to optimize the VMs selection. In addition, a new model for chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnosis and prediction is proposed to measure the performance of our VMs model. The prediction model of CKD is implemented using two consecutive techniques, which are linear regression (LR) and neural network (NN). LR is used to determine critical factors that influence on CKD. NN is used to predict of CKD. The results show that, the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the art models in total execution time the rate of 50%. In addition, the system efficiency regarding real-time data retrieval is greatly improved by 5.2%. In addition, the accuracy of hybrid intelligent model in predicting of CKD is 97.8%. The proposed model is superior to most of the referred models in the related works by 64%."

For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well --- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.",

The map indicates, for each pixel in the objects (or the background) of the originally binary picture, the shortest distance to the nearest pixel in the background (or the objects). A map with negligible errors can be produced in two picture scans which has to include forward and backward movement for each line. Thus, for expanding/shrinking purposes it may compete very successfully with iterative parallel propagation in the binary picture itself. It is shown that skeletons can be produced by simple procedures and since these are based on Euclidean distances it is assumed that they are superior to skeletons based on d4−, d8−, and even octagonal metrics."

Recognition experiments were performed using the database containing photographies of 423 persons. The experiments showed, that the proposed distance measure was among the first three best measures with respect to different characteristics of the biometric systems. The best recognition results were achieved using the following distance measures: simplified Mahalanobis, weighted angle-based distance, proposed modified SSE-based distance, angle-based distance between whitened feature vectors. Using modified SSE-based distance we need to extract less images in order to achieve 100% cumulative recognition than using any other tested distance measure. We also showed that using the algorithmic combination of distance measures we can achieve better recognition results than using the distances separately."

In such complicated decision making problem, it is flexible for experts to use comparative linguistic expressions to express their opinions since the linguistic expressions are much closer than single or simple linguistic term to human way of thinking and cognition. The hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) turns out to be a powerful tool in representing and eliciting the comparative linguistic expressions. In order to develop some approaches to decision making with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information, in this paper, we firstly introduce a family of novel distance and similarity measures for HFLTSs, such as the cosine distance and similarity measures, the weighted cosine distance and similarity measures, the order weighted cosine distance and similarity measures, and the continuous cosine distance and similarity measures. All these distance and similarity measures are proposed from the geometric point of view while the existing distance and similarity measures over HFLTSs are based on the different forms of algebra distance measures. Afterwards, based on the hesitant fuzzy linguistic cosine distance measures between hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements, the cosine-distance-based HFL-TOPSIS method and the cosine-distance-based HFL-VIKOR method are developed to dealing with hesitant fuzzy linguistic multiple criteria decision making problems. The step by step algorithms of these two methods are given for the convenience of applications. Finally, a numerical example concerning the selection of ERP systems is given to illustrate the validation and efficiency of the proposed methods."

We carry out an extensive and systematic evaluation of this method on 29 datasets, using decision tree-based estimators. With respect to popular ensemble methods, these experiments show that the proposed method provides on par performance in terms of accuracy while simultaneously lowering the memory needs, and attains significantly better performance when memory is severely constrained.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148-156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

	abstract={Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genetic aberrations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genes may account for reduced enzyme activities and elevated plasma homocysteine levels. In 15 unrelated Dutch patients with homozygous CBS deficiency, we observed the 833T-->C (I278T) mutation in 50\% of the alleles. Very recently, we identified a common mutation (677C-->T; A-->V) in the MTHFR gene, which, in homozygous state, is responsible for the thermolabile phenotype and which is associated with decreased specific MTHRF activity and elevated homocysteine levels. We screened 60 cardiovascular patients and 111 controls for these two mutations, to determine whether these mutations are risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease. Heterozygosity for the 833T-->C mutation in the CBS gene was observed in one individual of the control group but was absent in patients with premature cardiovascular disease. Homozygosity for the 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene was found in (15\%) of 60 cardiovascular patients and in only 6 (approximately 5\%) of 111 control individuals (odds ratio 3.1 [95\% confidence interval 1.0-9.2]). Because of both the high prevalence of the 833T-->C mutation among homozygotes for CBS deficiency and its absence in 60 cardiovascular patients, we may conclude that heterozygosity for CBS deficiency does not appear to be involved in premature cardiovascular disease. However, a frequent homozygous mutation in the MTHFR gene is associated with a threefold increase in risk for premature cardiovascular disease.},

VHL disease results from germline mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene and is characterized by variable expression and the development of benign and malignant neoplasms in multiple organs. The clinical management of VHL disease is challenging and requires a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. However, early detection of VHL tumors by annual surveillance has improved the prognosis for VHL gene carriers. Complex genotype-phenotype correlations for the major manifestations of VHL disease result from allelic heterogeneity and suggest that the VHL gene product has multiple and tissue-specific functions. Recent studies suggest that the VHL protein represents the adaptor unit of an Skp1-Cdc53/Cul1-F-box (SCF)-like protein complex which targets specific proteins for ubiquitinylation and proteolysis. Tumors from VHL patients and sporadic tumors with VHL gene inactivation (e.g., most clear cell RCC) are hypervascular and overexpress hypoxia-inducible mRNAs such as vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF). Recently, pVHL has been shown to regulate proteolysis of the transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2 (EPAS). Thus absence or inactivation of pVHL leads to constitutive HIF-1 and HIF-2 expression, which activates transcription of VEGF and other hypozia-inducible mRNAs. Evidence for further pVHL functions including roles in fibronectin metabolism and cell cycle regulation has also been reported, but it is unclear whether these functions are mediated via pVHL-targeted proteolysis or other mechanisms. Clinical and laboratory studies of VHL disease have provided a paradigm for demonstrating the importance of familial cancer syndromes in elucidating mechanisms of tumorigenesis in familial and sporadic cancer."

Direct and indirect estimates of the mutation rate were 4.4 (95\% CI 0.9 to 7.9) x 10(-6)/gene/generation and 2.32 x 10(-6)/gene/generation respectively. There was no significant association between parental age or birth order and new mutations for VHL disease.},

	abstract = "Summary
	von Hippel-Lindau disease is a heritable multisystem cancer syndrome that is associated with a germline mutation of the VHL tumour suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 3. This disorder is not rare (about one in 36 000 livebirths) and is inherited as a highly penetrant autosomal dominant trait (ie, with a high individual risk of disease). Affected individuals are at risk of developing various benign and malignant tumours of the central nervous system, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, and reproductive adnexal organs. Because of the complexities associated with management of the various types of tumours in this disease, treatment is multidisciplinary. We present an overview of the clinical aspects, management, and treatment options for von Hippel-Lindau disease."

These mutations are mainly private with only one hot spot at codon 167 associated with pheochromocytoma. The germline mutations are essentially missense while somatic mutations include deletions, insertions and nonsense. To standardize the collection of these informations, facilitate the mutational analysis of the VHL gene and promote the genotype-phenotype analysis, a software package along with a computerized database have been created.

To begin an evaluation of the biological functions of the VHL gene product (pVHL), we prepared bacterial fusion protein between glutathione S-transferase and wild-type or mutant pVHLs. The fusion proteins were used to identify cellular proteins that bind to pVHL in vitro. Monkey kidney cells transfected with wild-type or mutant VHL cDNAs were used to identify cellular proteins that bind to pVHL in vivo. Wild-type pVHL consistently bound two cellular proteins with apparent molecular masses of 10 and 14 kilodaltons that were designated p10 and p14, respectively. Mapping studies with a panel of VHL deletion mutant proteins demonstrated that p10 and p14 bound to a 32-amino acid peptide located in the carboxy terminal portion of pVHL. Missense mutations located within this 32-amino acid peptide abrogated the ability of the VHL protein to bind p10 and p14. Of 67 VHL families with identified germline mutations, 42 families had mutations predicted to affect the p10/p14-binding region. Maintenance of the integrity of the p10/p14-binding region appears to be essential for cellular growth regulation by pVHL. {\textcopyright}1995 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {Inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene causes the familial cancer syndrome, VHL disease, characterized by a predisposition to renal cell carcinoma and other tumor types. Loss of VHL gene function also is found in a majority of sporadic renal carcinomas. A preponderance of the tumor-disposing inherited missense mutations detected in VHL disease are within the elongin-binding domain of VHL. This region mediates the formation of a multiprotein VHL complex containing elongin B, elongin C, cul-2, and Rbx1. This VHL complex is thought to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Here, we report that VHL proteins harboring mutations which disrupt elongin binding are unstable and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. In contrast, wild-type VHL proteins are directly stabilized by associating with both elongins B and C. In addition, elongins B and C are stabilized through their interactions with each other and VHL. Thus, the entire VHL/elongin complex is resistant to proteasomal degradation. Because the elongin-binding domain of VHL is frequently mutated in cancers, these results suggest that loss of elongin binding causes tumorigenesis by compromising VHL protein stability and/or potential VHL ubiquitination functions.

AdaBoost can boost a weak learning algorithm with an accuracy slightly better than random guessing into an arbitrarily accurate strong learning algorithm, bringing about a new method and a new design idea to the design of learning algorithm. This paper first introduces how Boosting, just a conjecture when proposed, was proved right, and how this proof led to the origin of AdaBoost algorithm. Second, training and generalization error of AdaBoost are analyzed to explain why AdaBoost can successfully improve the accuracy of a weak learning algorithm. Third, different theoretical models to analyze AdaBoost are given. Meanwhile, many variants derived from these models are presented. Fourth, extensions of binary-class AdaBoost to multiclass AdaBoost are described. Besides, applications of AdaBoost algorithm are also introduced. Finally, interested directions which need to be further studied are discussed. For Boosting theory, these directions include deducing a tighter generalization error bound and finding a more precise weak learning condition in multiclass problem. For AdaBoost, the stopping conditions, the way to enhance anti-noise capability and how to improve the accuracy by optimizing the diversity of the base classifiers, are good questions to be in-depth researched."

The pseudo-residuals are the gradient of the loss functional being minimized, with respect to the model values at each training data point evaluated at the current step. It is shown that both the approximation accuracy and execution speed of gradient boosting can be substantially improved by incorporating randomization into the procedure. Specifically, at each iteration a subsample of the training data is drawn at random (without replacement) from the full training data set. This randomly selected subsample is then used in place of the full sample to fit the base learner and compute the model update for the current iteration. This randomized approach also increases robustness against overcapacity of the base learner."

A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

The survey includes a formulation of the backpropagation neural network architecture to make it a valid neural network and a proof that the backpropagation mean squared error function exists and is differentiable. Also included in the survey is a theorem showing that any L2 function can be implemented to any desired degree of accuracy with a three-layer backpropagation neural network. An appendix presents a speculative neurophysiological model illustrating the way in which the backpropagation neural network architecture might plausibly be implemented in the mammalian brain for corticocortical learning between nearby regions of cerebral cortex. One of the crucial decisions in the design of the backpropagation architecture is the selection of a sigmoidal activation function."

Many of these functions were also developed to estimate the consequence of mutation on protein stability or binding affinity. In the current study, we chose six different methods that were previously reported as being able to predict the change in protein stability (ΔΔG) upon mutation: CC/PBSA, EGAD, FoldX, I-Mutant2.0, Rosetta and Hunter. We evaluated their performance on a large set of 2156 single mutations, avoiding for each program the mutations used for training. The correlation coefficients between experimental and predicted ΔΔG values were in the range of 0.59 for the best and 0.26 for the worst performing method. All the tested computational methods showed a correct trend in their predictions, but failed in providing the precise values. This is not due to lack in precision of the experimental data, which showed a correlation coefficient of 0.86 between different measurements. Combining the methods did not significantly improve prediction accuracy compared to a single method. These results suggest that there is still room for improvement, which is crucial if we want forcefields to perform better in their various tasks.}",

The geometry optimization procedure was first tested on a new benchmark of 2141 ordered pairs of X-ray crystal structures of proteins that differ by a single point mutation, the largest data set to date. An empirical energy function, which includes terms representing the energy contributions of the folded and denatured proteins and uses the predicted mutant side chain conformation, was fit to a training set consisting of half of a diverse set of 1816 experimental stability values for single point mutations in 81 different proteins. The data included a substantial number of small to large residue mutations not considered by previous prediction studies. After removing 22 (≈2\%) outliers, the stability calculation gave a standard deviation of 1.08 kcal/mol with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. The prediction method was then tested on the remaining half of the experimental data, giving a standard deviation of 1.10 kcal/mol and covariance of 0.66 for 97\% of the test set. A regression fit of the energy function to a subset of 137 mutants, for which both native and mutant structures were available, gave a prediction error comparable to that for the complete training set with predicted side chain conformations. We found that about half of the variation is due to conformation-independent residue contributions. Finally, a fit to the experimental stability data using these residue parameters exclusively suggests guidelines for improving protein stability in the absence of detailed structure information.

	abstract={Motivation: Accurate prediction of protein stability is important for understanding the molecular underpinnings of diseases and for the design of new proteins. We introduce a novel approach for the prediction of changes in protein stability that arise from a single-site amino acid substitution; the approach uses available data on mutations occurring in the same position and in other positions. Our algorithm, named Pro-Maya (Protein Mutant stAbilitY Analyzer), combines a collaborative filtering baseline model, Random Forests regression and a diverse set of features. Pro-Maya predicts the stability free energy difference of mutant versus wild type, denoted as DDG.Results: We evaluated our algorithm extensively using cross-validation on two previously utilized datasets of single amino acid mutations and a (third) validation set. The results indicate that using known DDG values of mutations at the query position improves the accuracy of DDG predictions for other mutations in that position. The accuracy of our predictions in such cases significantly surpasses that of similar methods, achieving, e.g. a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.79 and a root mean square error of 0.96 on the validation set. Because Pro-Maya uses a diverse set of features, including predictions using two other methods, it also performs slightly better than other methods in the absence of additional experimental data on the query positions.Availability: Pro-Maya is freely available via web server at http://bental.tau.ac.il/ProMaya.Contact:nirb@tauex.tau.ac.il; wolf@cs.tau.ac.ilSupplementary Information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract={Motivation: The folding free energy is an important characteristic of proteins stability and is directly related to protein's wild-type function. The changes of protein's stability due to naturally occurring mutations, missense mutations, are typically causing diseases. Single point mutations made in vitro are frequently used to assess the contribution of given amino acid to the stability of the protein. In both cases, it is desirable to predict the change of the folding free energy upon single point mutations in order to either provide insights of the molecular mechanism of the change or to design new experimental studies.Results: We report an approach that predicts the free energy change upon single point mutation by utilizing the 3D structure of the wild-type protein. It is based on variation of the molecular mechanics Generalized Born (MMGB) method, scaled with optimized parameters (sMMGB) and utilizing specific model of unfolded state. The corresponding mutations are built in silico and the predictions are tested against large dataset of 1109 mutations with experimentally measured changes of the folding free energy. Benchmarking resulted in root mean square deviation = 1.78 kcal/mol and slope of the linear regression fit between the experimental data and the calculations was 1.04. The sMMGB is compared with other leading methods of predicting folding free energy changes upon single mutations and results discussed with respect to various parameters.Availability: All the pdb files we used in this article can be downloaded from http://compbio.clemson.edu/downloadDir/mentaldisorders/sMMGB\_pdb.rarContact:ealexov@clemson.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract={Abstract There is substantial interest in methods designed to predict the effect of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on protein function, given their potential relationship to heritable diseases. Current state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms, such as random forest (RF), train models that classify single amino acid mutations in proteins as either neutral or deleterious to function. However, it is frequently the case that the functional effect of a polymorphism on a protein resides between these two extremes. The utilization of classifiers that incorporate fuzzy logic provides a natural extension in order to account for the spectrum of possible functional consequences. We generated a dataset of single amino acid substitutions in human proteins having known three-dimensional structures. Each variant was uniquely represented as a feature vector that included computational geometry and knowledge-based statistical potential predictors obtained though application of Delaunay tessellation of protein structures. Additional attributes consisted of physicochemical properties of the native and replacement amino acids as well as topological location of the mutated residue position in the solved structure. Classification performance of the RF algorithm was evaluated on a training set consisting of the disease-associated and neutral nsSNPs taken from our dataset, and attributes were ranked according to their relative importance. Similarly, we evaluated the performance of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The utility of statistical geometry predictors was compared with that of traditional structural and evolutionary attributes employed by other researchers, revealing an equally effective yet complementary methodology. Among all attributes in our feature set, the statistical geometry predictors were found to be the most highly ranked. On the basis of the AUC (area under the ROC curve) measure of performance, the ANFIS and RF models were equally effective when only statistical geometry features were utilized. Tenfold cross-validation studies evaluating AUC, balanced error rate (BER), and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) showed that our RF model was at least comparable with the well-established methods of SIFT and PolyPhen. The trained RF and ANFIS models were each subsequently used to predict the disease potential of human nsSNPs in our dataset that are currently unclassified (http://rna.gmu.edu/FuzzySnps/).

An important step in this direction is to discover how and when proteins interact inside the cell to accomplish their tasks. Many of the cellular functions depend on reversible protein modifications like phosphorylation. To sense these modifications, cells have protein domains capable of binding phosphorylated proteins such as the SH2 domain. In this work, we show that it is possible to use the three-dimensional structure of protein domains to predict its binding preferences. Using a computational tool called FoldX, we have predicted the binding specificity of several human SH2 domains. These predictions, based on the computational analysis of the 3-D structure, were shown to be of similar accuracy as those obtained from experimental binding assays. We show here that it is also possible to understand how a mutation changes the binding preference of protein binding domains, opening the way for better understanding of some disease causing mutations. The combination of this novel computational approach with other sources of information allowed us to provide a set of high-confidence novel interactions for the proteins here studied.},

However, distinguishing from sequence information which mutations have real effects in the protein's function is not trivial. Protein design tools are commonly used to explain mutations that affect protein stability, or protein-protein interaction, but not for mutations that could affect protein-DNA binding. Here, we used the protein design algorithm FoldX to model all known missense mutations in the paired box domain of Pax6, a highly conserved transcription factor involved in eye development and in several diseases such as aniridia. The validity of FoldX to deal with protein-DNA interactions was demonstrated by showing that high levels of accuracy can be achieved for mutations affecting these interactions. Also we showed that protein-design algorithms can accurately reproduce experimental DNA-binding logos. We conclude that 88\% of the Pax6 mutations can be linked to changes in intrinsic stability (77\%) and/or to its capabilities to bind DNA (30\%). Our study emphasizes the importance of structure-based analysis to understand the molecular basis of diseases and shows that protein-DNA interactions can be analyzed to the same level of accuracy as protein stability, or protein-protein interactions.},

One strategy for the synthesis and optical resolution of ?-phenylalanine and other important aromatic ?-amino acids is biotransformation by utilizing an ?-transaminase from Variovorax paradoxus. We designed variants of this ?-TA to gain higher process stability on the basis of predictions calculated by using the FoldX software. We herein report the first thermostabilization of a nonthermostable S-selective ?-TA by FoldX-guided site-directed mutagenesis. The melting point (Tm) of our best-performing mutant was increased to 59.3?{\textdegree}C, an increase of 4.0?{\textdegree}C relative to the Tm value of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the mutant fully retained its specific activity.},

While the streptococcal endolysin PlyC has been validated in vitro and in vivo for its therapeutic efficacy, the inherent thermosusceptible structure of the enzyme correlates to transient long-term stability, thereby hindering the feasibility of developing the enzyme as an antimicrobial. Here, we thermostabilized the cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) domain of the PlyCA catalytic subunit of PlyC using a FoldX-driven computational protein engineering approach. Using a combination of FoldX and Rosetta algorithms, as well as visual inspection, a final list of PlyC point mutant candidates with predicted stabilizing ΔΔG values was assembled and thermally characterized. Five of the eight point mutations were found experimentally to be destabilizing, a result most likely attributable to computationally modeling a complex and dynamic nine-subunit holoenzyme with a corresponding 3.3-Å X-ray crystal structure. However, one of the mutants, PlyC (PlyCA) T406R, was shown experimentally to increase the thermal denaturation temperature by ∼2.2°C and kinetic stability 16-fold over wild type. This mutation is expected to introduce a thermally advantageous hydrogen bond between the Q106 side chain of the N-terminal glycosyl hydrolase domain and the R406 side chain of the C-terminal CHAP domain.}",

	abstract={CUPSAT (Cologne University Protein Stability Analysis Tool) is a web tool to analyse and predict protein stability changes upon point mutations (single amino acid mutations). This program uses structural environment specific atom potentials and torsion angle potentials to predict DDG, the difference in free energy of unfolding between wild-type and mutant proteins. It requires the protein structure in Protein Data Bank format and the location of the residue to be mutated. The output consists information about mutation site, its structural features (solvent accessibility, secondary structure and torsion angles), and comprehensive information about changes in protein stability for 19 possible substitutions of a specific amino acid mutation. Additionally, it also analyses the ability of the mutated amino acids to adapt the observed torsion angles. Results were tested on 1538 mutations from thermal denaturation and 1603 mutations from chemical denaturation experiments. Several validation tests (split-sample, jack-knife and k -fold) were carried out to ensure the reliability, accuracy and transferability of the prediction method that gives \>80\% prediction accuracy for most of these validation tests. Thus, the program serves as a valuable tool for the analysis of protein design and stability. The tool is accessible from the link http://cupsat.uni-koeln.de .},

	abstract={Abstract The distance-dependent structure-derived potentials developed so far all employed a reference state that can be characterized as a residue (atom)-averaged state. Here, we establish a new reference state called the distance-scaled, finite ideal-gas reference (DFIRE) state. The reference state is used to construct a residue-specific all-atom potential of mean force from a database of 1011 nonhomologous (less than 30\% homology) protein structures with resolution less than 2 {\AA}. The new all-atom potential recognizes more native proteins from 32 multiple decoy sets, and raises an average Z-score by 1.4 units more than two previously developed, residue-specific, all-atom knowledge-based potentials. When only backbone and C? atoms are used in scoring, the performance of the DFIRE-based potential, although is worse than that of the all-atom version, is comparable to those of the previously developed potentials on the all-atom level. In addition, the DFIRE-based all-atom potential provides the most accurate prediction of the stabilities of 895 mutants among three knowledge-based all-atom potentials. Comparison with several physical-based potentials is made.},

	abstract={Motivation: Accurate prediction of protein stability is important for understanding the molecular underpinnings of diseases and for the design of new proteins. We introduce a novel approach for the prediction of changes in protein stability that arise from a single-site amino acid substitution; the approach uses available data on mutations occurring in the same position and in other positions. Our algorithm, named Pro-Maya (Protein Mutant stAbilitY Analyzer), combines a collaborative filtering baseline model, Random Forests regression and a diverse set of features. Pro-Maya predicts the stability free energy difference of mutant versus wild type, denoted as DDG.Results: We evaluated our algorithm extensively using cross-validation on two previously utilized datasets of single amino acid mutations and a (third) validation set. The results indicate that using known DDG values of mutations at the query position improves the accuracy of DDG predictions for other mutations in that position. The accuracy of our predictions in such cases significantly surpasses that of similar methods, achieving, e.g. a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.79 and a root mean square error of 0.96 on the validation set. Because Pro-Maya uses a diverse set of features, including predictions using two other methods, it also performs slightly better than other methods in the absence of additional experimental data on the query positions.Availability: Pro-Maya is freely available via web server at http://bental.tau.ac.il/ProMaya.Contact:nirb@tauex.tau.ac.il; wolf@cs.tau.ac.ilSupplementary Information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract={To mitigate the congestion caused by the ever increasing number of privately owned automobiles, public transit is highly promoted by transportation agencies worldwide. A better understanding of travel patterns and regularity at the "magnitude" level will enable transit authorities to evaluate the services they offer, adjust marketing strategies, retain loyal customers and improve overall transit performance. However, it is fairly challenging to identify travel patterns for individual transit riders in a large dataset. This paper proposes an efficient and effective data-mining procedure that models the travel patterns of transit riders in Beijing, China. Transit riders' trip chains are identified based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of their smart card transaction data. The Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm then analyzes the identified trip chains to detect transit riders' historical travel patterns and the K-Means++ clustering algorithm and the rough-set theory are jointly applied to cluster and classify travel pattern regularities. The performance of the rough-set-based algorithm is compared with those of other prevailing classification algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed rough-set-based algorithm outperforms other commonly used data-mining algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract={This article reviews important emerging statistical concepts, data mining techniques, and applications that have been recently developed and used for genomic data analysis. First, general background and some critical issues in genomic data mining are summarized. A novel concept of statistical significance is described, the so-called "false discovery rate"--the rate of false-positives among all positive findings--which has been suggested to control the error rate of numerous false-positives in large screening biological data analysis. Two recent statistical testing methods are then introduced: significance analysis of microarray and local pooled error tests. Statistical modeling in genomic data analysis is then presented, such as analysis of variance and heterogeneous error modeling approaches that have been suggested for analyzing microarray data obtained from multiple experimental or biological conditions. Two sections then describe data exploration and discovery tools largely termed as supervised learning and unsupervised learning. The former approaches include several multivariate statistical methods to investigate coexpression patterns of multiple genes, and the latter are the classification methods to discover genomic biomarker signatures for predicting important subclasses of human diseases. The last section briefly summarizes various genomic data mining approaches in biomedical pathway analysis and patient outcome or chemotherapeutic response prediction.},

	abstract={MOTIVATION: Modern biology is shifting from the 'one gene one postdoc' approach to genomic analyses that include the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes. The importance of efficient access to concise and integrated biomedical information to support data analysis and decision making is therefore increasing rapidly, in both academic and industrial research. However, knowledge discovery in the widely scattered resources relevant for biomedical research is often a cumbersome and non-trivial task, one that requires a significant amount of training and effort. RESULTS: To develop a model for a new type of topic-specific overview resource that provides efficient access to distributed information, we designed a database called 'GeneCards'. It is a freely accessible Web resource that offers one hypertext 'card' for each of the more than 7000 human genes that currently have an approved gene symbol published by the HUGO/GDB nomenclature committee. The presented information aims at giving immediate insight into current knowledge about the respective gene, including a focus on its functions in health and disease. It is compiled by Perl scripts that automatically extract relevant information from several databases, including SWISS-PROT, OMIM, Genatlas and GDB. Analyses of the interactions of users with the Web interface of GeneCards triggered development of easy-to-scan displays optimized for human browsing. Also, we developed algorithms that offer 'ready-to-click' query reformulation support, to facilitate information retrieval and exploration. Many of the long-term users turn to GeneCards to quickly access information about the function of very large sets of genes, for example in the realm of large-scale expression studies using 'DNA chip' technology or two-dimensional protein electrophoresis.

In addition to conventional human resource management approaches, there is an urgent need to develop effective personnel selection mechanism to find the talents who are the most suitable to their own organizations. This study aims to fill the gap by developing a data mining framework based on decision tree and association rules to generate useful rules for personnel selection. The results can provide decision rules relating personnel information with work performance and retention. An empirical study was conducted in a semiconductor company to support their hiring decision for indirect labors including engineers and managers with different job functions. The results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach.

Molecular recognition of ATP in proteins is a subject of great importance for understanding enzymatic mechanism and for drug design. We have carried out a large-scale data mining of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to analyze molecular determinants for recognition of the adenine moiety of ATP by proteins. Non-bonded intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking interactions, and cation–π interactions) between adenine base and surrounding residues in its binding pockets are systematically analyzed for 68 non-redundant, high-resolution crystal structures of adenylate-binding proteins. In addition to confirming the importance of the widely known hydrogen bonding, we found out that cation–π interactions between adenine base and positively charged residues (Lys and Arg) and π–π stacking interactions between adenine base and surrounding aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp) are also crucial for adenine binding in proteins. On average, there exist 2.7 hydrogen bonding interactions, 1.0 π–π stacking interactions, and 0.8 cation–π interactions in each adenylate-binding protein complex. Furthermore, a high-level quantum chemical analysis was performed to analyze contributions of each of the three forms of intermolecular interactions (i.e. hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking interactions, and cation–π interactions) to the overall binding force of the adenine moiety of ATP in proteins. Intermolecular interaction energies for representative configurations of intermolecular complexes were analyzed using the supermolecular approach at the MP2/6-311+G∗ level, which resulted in substantial interaction strengths for all the three forms of intermolecular interactions. This work represents a timely undertaking at a historical moment when a large number of X-ray crystallographic structures of proteins with bound ATP ligands have become available, and when high-level quantum chemical analysis of intermolecular interactions of large biomolecular systems becomes computationally feasible. The establishment of the molecular basis for recognition of the adenine moiety of ATP in proteins will directly impact molecular design of ATP-binding site targeted enzyme inhibitors such as kinase inhibitors."

	abstract={As an important preprocessing technology in text classification, feature selection can improve the scalability, efficiency and accuracy of a text classifier. In general, a good feature selection method should consider domain and algorithm characteristics. As the Na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifier is very simple and efficient and highly sensitive to feature selection, so the research of feature selection specially for it is significant. This paper presents two feature evaluation metrics for the Na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifier applied on multi-class text datasets: Multi-class Odds Ratio (MOR), and Class Discriminating Measure (CDM). Experiments of text classification with Na{\"i}ve Bayesian classifiers were carried out on two multi-class texts collections. As the results indicate, CDM and MOR gain obviously better selecting effect than other feature selection approaches.},

	abstract={Abstract The average contribution of individual residue to folding stability and its dependence on buried accessible surface area (ASA) are obtained by two different approaches. One is based on experimental mutation data, and the other uses a new knowledge-based atom?atom potential of mean force. We show that the contribution of a residue has a significant correlation with buried ASA and the regression slopes of 20 amino acid residues (called the buriability) are all positive (pro-burial). The buriability parameter provides a quantitative measure of the driving force for the burial of a residue. The large buriability gap observed between hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues is responsible for the burial of hydrophobic residues in soluble proteins. Possible factors that contribute to the buriability gap are discussed. Proteins 2004;54:000?000. ? 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
